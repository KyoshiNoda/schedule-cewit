# Project for SBU Cewit 2022 - Hacking into the Metaverse.
 Builds a college schedule for students. Users are able to add a courses from Monday - Friday and add information such as location, professor name etc.
 
 
 # What's next for College Schedule Finder
This project is something we are very passionate about. Ideally we would love to expand this project as a tool students can actually use to make new friends, spend quality time with others between classes etc. 
The next step for this project is to incorporate making accounts for users and match you with people throughout the school. This way you can make new friends between classes and have filters on things like age, major, gender etc.
